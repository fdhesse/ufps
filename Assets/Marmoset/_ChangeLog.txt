Skyshop 1.11 change log
====================
Features:
- Added Matte shaders for projecting skybox onto scene geometry (useful in CG-to-photo compositing)
- Global skies can now also be box projected (for simple scenes)
- Switched to Schlick fresnel approximation (better & faster)
- Terrain shader detail weight is a float text field instead of a slider (was very hard to set consistently)

Mobile
- OpenGL ES 3.0 support (yay!)
- Reduced vertex interpolants in mobile shaders (should run on Galaxy S3 and other old devices again)
- Removed custom UV tiling per texture from mobile shaders, reducing very slow, dependent texture reads
  (All mobile UV tiling now comes from the diffuse texture tiling & offset UI)
- Sky and Skybox now rotate on mobile devices

Major Bugs:
- Animated Meshes now get bound to local skies
- Blend to global sky now finishes and doesn't leave blending enabled forever
- SkyAnchor now cleans up memory allocated by material instancing (previously a memory leak)
- Force cubemaps to trilinearly filter everywhere (improves mipmapped gloss)

- Cubemaps created with the "New" button are named after the Sky object they were created through
- Added "Bumped Specular IBL Fast" shader with Diffuse(RGB)Spec(A) to the "Mobile/Self-Illumin/" category (iOS runs out of texture samplers otherwise)
- Reduced run-time memory churn in SkyAnchor and SkyManager (significantly!)
- SkyAnchor now caches renderer.materials lists (greatly reduces memory use)
- Added "Dynamic Materials" option to SkyManager in case material caches need to update at run-time (important if materials are added, removed, or replaced in renderer.materials).
- Added "Skip Time" feature to SkyManager API to set/fast-forward sky blending.
- Beta shaders are no longer zipped up in the install (hurray!)

Bug Fixes:
- SkyManager now only searches for MeshRenderer objects (a more robust fix for white 2D Sprites)
- Enabled MaterialPropertyBlock code again (helps material instancing and memory churn)

- Fixed all iOS mobile terrain and vegetation shader warnings (GLES does not support vertex-only fallback shaders)
- Changed "Action" to explicit "System.Action" everywhere
- Removed remaining "MARMO_SPECULAR_FILTER" from all skin shaders and fallbacks
- Exposed Translucency slider in "Skin Fast IBL"
- Fixed D3D11 forward transparent cutout (for some reason clip() is required)

Skyshop 1.07 Change Log
=====================
Major Features:

- Box Projection for all shaders
- Spherical Harmonics Diffuse IBL
- new Sky & Sky Manager system 
- new Sky API

- Mobile terrain shaders that don’t sample per-layer normal maps
- Fixed soft-occlusion tree shaders
- Faster shader building (mobile only builds for mobile, standard only non-mobile)
- Less buggy transparency, matching Unity's transparent shaders more closely (don’t write to z-buffer)

Known Issues:
- Advanced terrain shaders won't work on mobile (too many texture samplers)
	- Use Mobile/Terrain/ shaders instead
- Gamma color space breaks Render-To-Cubemap mode and GPU Compute (results have gamma issues).
	- Capture and image-process in linear color-space if possible
	- Disable Render-To-Cubemap capture and use regular "Compute" otherwise


Skyshop 1.06.2 Hot-Fix
=====================
 - Compute results no longer washed out (Input panoramas no longer auto-converted to linear space)
 - RGBM importer now runs a clean-up pass, setting all imported RGBM .PNG files to
 	- uncompressed 	
 	- max size 4096 
 	- not linear (does not bypass sRGB sampling)
 	- no non-power-of-2 scaling
 - Skyshop texture slots perform similar check on inputs and suggest formatting changes to be made.
 - Added translucency back to Marmoset Skin IBL


Skyshop 1.061 Change Log
======================
 - Fixed Compute button being disabled when no Sky was in scene (endDisabledGroup() mismatch).

Skyshop 1.06 Change Log
=====================
Major Features
 - Toggle for automatic/manual binding of indvidiual skies
 - Sky script now handles OnTriggerEnter and OnTriggerExit events

 - "Panorama Name" field for easy naming of cubemaps created with "New" and "New All"
 - Simple Terrain shaders work on mobile platforms

Edit/Skyshop
 - Unity no longer freezes when entering play mode with an Input Panorama present (serialization/memory bug)
 - Adjusting intensity and exposure sliders no longer causes SH recompute (no more lagging!)
 - Skyshop convolutions are no longer brighter than the source image (better normalization term)
 - Input Panorama textures are set to "Bypass sRGB" before being used as input (fixes LDR horiz. cross gamma issue)
 - Cubemap probes can be captured at 2048x2048 now
 
Shaders
 - Skin shader now also scatters Unity light probes
 - Skin and spherical harmonics brightness now matches other IBL cubes
 - Fixed translucency with omni and spotlights
 - Added 90 more degrees of range to anisotropic direction (now 0-180 degrees)
 - Vertex Color and Vertex Occlusion shaders work with Unity's image and post effects (can't be custom render-type)
 - Mobile Translucency and Simple Glass shaders work on Android again (was missing #MARMO_ALPHA)
 - Shaders now keep a float _SkyID to make sure skies can only unbind themselves from specific renderers
 - Box projection no longer affects diffuse lookups (it is expensive and looks bad with a diffuse distribution).
 
Known Issues
 - Box projection works only in Unity 4.3+ (#pragma multi-compile requirements).
 - Skyshop cubemap previews have to be refreshed manually when returning from play mode (Reload All button).
   This is an alternative to the slow, memory-intensive serialization method that caused Unity to freeze in 1.05
 - Vertex Occlusion and Vertex Color are ignored when capturing HDR cubemaps, a limitation of Unity's RenderType
   and replacement shader system.
 - Marmoset's Advanced Terrain shaders do not work on mobile platforms yet (investigation continues).

New shader feature #defines
 - #define MARMO_BOX_PROJECTION 1
 - #define MARMO_SPHERICAL_HARMONICS 1
 - #define MARMO_ALPHA

Alpha
 - Shaders will write 1.0 into the output alpha unless this flag is defined

 - Can also be toggled as a multi-compile keyword
 - This feature is considered beta and only enabled in the beta category of shaders

Spherical Harmonics
 - All skies now compute spherical harmonics coefficients to be used in place of the diffuse IBL cubemap
 - SH is computed from the specular, skybox, or diffuse cube depending on which is present

 - SH will be used in place of the diffuse IBL cubemap in shaders that enable the feature
 - Enabled with #define MARMO_SPHERICAL_HARMONICS 1
 - This feature is considered beta and only enabled in the beta category of shaders

Known Issues
 - Unity 4.2 grass & detail shaders are now rendered incorrectly, they still need manual sRGB sampling which was fixed in Unity 4.3.0.
 - Old Sky objects cannot be turned into prefabs (they lose script references), use Edit->Skyshop->Create Prefabs from Selected
 - RGBM probe does not capture transparent objects
 - RGBM probe does not capture tree or grass billboards properly
